SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION:
This project focuses on recognizing emotions from speech data using machine learning techniques. The aim is to classify speech samples into various emotional categories such as happy, sad, angry, etc., to enhance applications in customer service, mental health monitoring, and more.
The project uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify emotions from speech. The approach includes feature extraction using "Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)" model training with TensorFlow/Keras. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize model performance.
The model achieved 0.9780 accuracy in classifying emotions. The results show that the model effectively distinguishes between emotions like happy, sad, and angry.
